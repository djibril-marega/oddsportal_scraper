    """
    Main asynchronous function that orchestrates the retrieval and storage of historical event data
    for both competitions and teams on OddsPortal.

    The function performs several key tasks:
    1. **Competition data retrieval**:
    - If a competition name is provided, it initializes `odds_data["events"]`,
        retrieves the competition's match history via `get_competition_match_history`,
        and saves the results using `save_odds_data` if any events are found.

    2. **Team data retrieval**:
    - If a team name is provided, it builds and adds the team's URL to `links_teams`.
    - When team links are available, it processes them using `get_team_match_history`
        to retrieve historical match data for each team.
    - The resulting data for each team is saved individually using `save_odds_data`
        with the type set to `"team"`.

    3. **Multiple competition processing**:
    - If competitions exist in `list_regions_competitions`, it retrieves match histories
        for several competitions concurrently via `get_several_competitions_match_history`.
    - Each competition dataset with non-empty events is saved using `save_odds_data`.

    Returns:
        None â€” The function's main goal is to collect, process, and persist historical match data
        for competitions and teams based on the provided parameters.
